Aintegrant ain't Integrant, it's Async Integrant!

In short, Aintegrant is the async version of Integrant. Particularly in ClojureScript,
application initialization may involve a various kinds of asynchronous execution,
such as Web API call, resource fetch or file I/O (on Node.js). Aintegrant will work in such cases.

Also, Aintegrant is completely compatible with Integrant: Initialization code for Integrant
perfectly runs via Aintegrant, and migration for turning some of the initialization asynchronous
usually takes just a little effort.

**Note:** Aintegrant focuses on the asynchronization of Integrant's app initialization facility, and NOT
on the parallelization of that (at least for now). So, each component's `init-key`/`halt-key!` etc.
is always performed one by one.
