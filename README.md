# Aintegrant

Aintegrant ain't Integrant, it's Async Integrant!

In short, Aintegrant is the async version of Integrant. Particularly in ClojureScript,
application initialization may involve a various kinds of asynchronous execution,
such as Web API call, resource fetch or file I/O (on Node.js). Aintegrant will work in such cases.

Also, Aintegrant is completely compatible with Integrant: Initialization code for Integrant
perfectly runs via Aintegrant, and migration for turning some of the initialization asynchronous
usually takes just a little effort.
